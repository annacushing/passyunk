                <h3>PARADISO</h3>
                <p>The beginning of Passyunk’s renaissance can be accredited to the creation of this Italian fine dining by owner Lynn Rinaldi. As a bonus to the food, Paradiso also features fresh rooftop-grown produce and weekly live jazz.</p>

                <p>Eat pastrami-and-Swiss bao buns, maple syrup matzo-meal turnip cakes, and soup dumplings at this nontraditional dim sum parlor. Hangout as inventive Asian cocktails come by the glass or pitcher.</p>

                <h3>ULTIMO COFFEE</h3>
                <p>The baristas are friendly, the atmosphere is laid-back, and one cup of coffee is the equivalent of several anywhere else. There’s nothing like the caffeine high from Ultimo’s 12 ounce, 200 mg of caffeine cup.</p>
